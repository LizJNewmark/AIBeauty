<p> A study by Joy Buolamwini from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, found an error rate of 0.8% for light-skinned men and a high 34.7% for dark-skinned women, showing several biases in its shape and design. </p>


<p> This fact raises the question if artificial intelligence has the potential to discriminate against Latino buyers. According to Nielsen, technology is helping to enable customer personalization in stores and online, and artificial intelligence is disrupting the whole customer experience by creating personalized recommendations online and in social media and shaping customers' experience in stores. </p>


<p> Latino buyers' consumer behavior is also in the middle of that change, impacting the entire industry. The relevance of this group is that it has the fastest buying growth, 13.1% in 2023, and spent more than 19% of the average consumer in 2022. Accordingly, a study from Nielsen showed that despite 51% of them primarily buying in stores, 38% combine in-store and online purchases, especially millennials, with 38%.</p>


<p> This preference sheds light on the potential of discrimination against Latino communities in algorithms such as the ones that Buolamwini is studying. She told MIT Technology Review that, amid the current AI hype cycle, she sees a real risk of letting technology companies pen the rules that apply to them— repeating the very mistake that has previously allowed biased and oppressive technology to thrive, including the prolonging in the underrepresentation of this growing group.
